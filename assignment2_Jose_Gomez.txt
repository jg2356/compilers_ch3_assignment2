Written Assignment 2
1. (3.3.2) Describe the languages denoted by the following regular expressions:
a) a(a|b)*a
The language is a character sequence of 'a' and 'b'  which always starts and ends with 'a'.

b) ((epsilon|a)b*)*
The language is a character sequence of 'a' and 'b'.

c) (a|b)*a(a|b)(a|b)
The language is a character sequence of 'a's and 'b's where the 3rd to last character is always an 'a'.

d) a*ba*ba*ba*
The language is a character sequence of 'a's and 'b's containing any number of 'a's but exactly 3 'b' characters.

e) (aa|bb)*((ab|ba)(aa|bb)*(ab|ba)(aa|bb)*)* 
The language is a character sequence of 'a's and 'b's always containing an even number of 'a's and 'b's, but that may contain a different number of 'a's and 'b's.

2. Write regular expressions for the following languages over the alphabet {a,b}:
a) The set of strings with at least three 'a's.
(a|b)*a(a|b)*a(a|b)*a(a|b)*

b) The set of strings with three consecutive 'a's.
(a|b)*aaa(a|b)* 

c) The set of strings with an odd number of 'a's.
(aa|b)*a(aa|b)*

d) The set of strings that do not contain the substring 'bba'.
(a|ba)*b*

3 & 4. NFA/DFAs
a) (a|b)*a(a|b)*a(a|b)*a(a|b)*


b) (a|b)*aaa(a|b)* 


c) (aa|b)*a(aa|b)*


d) (a|ba)*b*
